## Project Information

We created a fun typing race game using web sockets. In our web-based game, players can compete against friends in a real-time typing race game. Upon joining a game lobby, participants must ready up, which triggers a countdown. A countdown from 5 will begin, once the race begins, all players receive the same sentence to type. The first player to complete the sentence correctly wins the round. Throughout the game, each player's win count is tracked next to their names. Players can play as many rounds as they wish, who ever has the highest number of points at the end of the game, wins the game.
